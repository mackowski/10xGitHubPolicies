# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - 10x GitHub Policy Enforcer

## 1. Product Overview
The 10x GitHub Policy Enforcer is a GitHub App with an accompanying web UI designed to automate the enforcement of organizational policies and security best practices across all repositories within a GitHub organization. The application scans repositories for compliance against a centrally managed configuration file, performs automated actions on non-compliant repositories, and provides a simple dashboard for monitoring the overall compliance status.

## 2. User Problem
Engineering organizations, particularly Product Security Teams, face significant challenges in maintaining consistent standards and security postures across a growing number of GitHub repositories. The manual process of monitoring for compliance with organizational policies (e.g., presence of specific files, correct repository settings) is inefficient, prone to human error, and does not scale. This leads to security vulnerabilities, inconsistent project scaffolding, and a significant time investment for auditing and remediation. An automated tool is needed to continuously monitor compliance and enforce policies systematically.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Authentication and Authorization
*   Users must authenticate to the web UI via a "Login with GitHub" OAuth flow.
*   Access to the application's dashboard and features is restricted to members of a specific GitHub Team.
*   The authorized GitHub Team is defined in the application's configuration file.

### 3.2. Configuration
*   All application settings, including policies, actions, and access control, are managed through a single YAML file named `config.yaml`.
*   This configuration file must be located in the organization's `.github` repository.

### 3.3. Repository Scanning
*   The application scans all active (non-archived) repositories within the organization.
*   Scans are executed automatically on a daily schedule.
*   Users can trigger an "on-demand" scan manually from the web UI for immediate feedback.

### 3.4. Core Policies (MVP)
The application will support the following policies in its initial version:
1.  Verify the presence of an `AGENTS.md` file in the repository's root.
2.  Verify the presence of a `catalog-info.yaml` file in the repository's root.
3.  Verify that the repository's Workflow Permissions are set to 'Read repository contents and packages permissions'.

### 3.5. Automated Actions (MVP)
Based on policy violations, the application can be configured to take the following actions:
1.  *Create GitHub Issue*: Creates a labeled issue in the non-compliant repository. The application will prevent the creation of duplicate issues for the same violation.
2.  *Archive Repository*: Automatically archives the non-compliant repository, making it read-only.

### 3.6. Dashboard
The web UI will feature a simple dashboard that includes:
*   A list of all non-compliant repositories.
*   Details of the specific policies each repository is violating.
*   A summary metric showing the organization's overall repository compliance percentage.
*   A button to trigger an on-demand, organization-wide scan.
*   A simple text-based filter to search for repositories by name.

## 4. Product Boundaries

### 4.1. In Scope for MVP
*   All functional requirements listed in section 3.
*   Support for a single GitHub organization per installation.
*   A hosted web UI for the dashboard.

### 4.2. Out of Scope for MVP
*   Automatically fixing policy violations (e.g., creating the missing file or changing the setting).
*   Support for other version control systems like GitLab or Bitbucket.
*   Advanced policy types (e.g., checking file content, branch protection rules).
*   User-level permissions within the application; all authorized users have the same level of access.
*   Support for repository-level exceptions or overrides in the UI.

## 5. User Stories

*   Acceptance Criteria:
    1.  When a violation is detected, a GitHub issue is created in the non-compliant repository.
    2.  The issue title and body clearly describe the policy violation and provide guidance for remediation.
    3.  The issue is assigned a specific, configurable label (e.g., 'policy-violation').
    4.  The system checks for an existing open issue with the same label and title to prevent creating duplicate issues for the same unresolved violation.

### ID: US-011
*   Title: Automated Repository Archiving
*   Description: As the system, when a repository violates a policy configured with the 'archive-repo' action, I must archive the repository to prevent its further use.
*   Acceptance Criteria:
    1.  When a violation is detected for a policy with the 'archive-repo' action, the system makes an API call to GitHub to archive the corresponding repository.
    2.  The repository is successfully archived and becomes read-only.
    3.  The action is logged by the application for audit purposes.

## 6. Success Metrics
The success of the 10x GitHub Policy Enforcer will be measured by the following key metrics:
*   *Overall Compliance Rate*: The percentage of repositories in the organization that are compliant with all configured policies. Success is defined as a steady increase in this metric over time.
*   *Violation Remediation Time*: The average time between the creation of a policy violation issue by the application and its closure. A decrease in this time indicates the tool is effectively driving action.
*   *Manual Effort Reduction*: Qualitative feedback from the Product Security Team indicating a reduction in time spent manually auditing repositories.
*   *Dashboard Accuracy*: The dashboard accurately reflects the compliance status of all repositories based on the latest scan data.
*   *Action Reliability*: All configured actions (issue creation, repository archiving) are executed successfully and reliably for every detected violation.
