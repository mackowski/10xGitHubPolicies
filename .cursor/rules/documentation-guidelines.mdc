#### DOC_UPDATES

- Update relevant documentation in /docs when modifying features
- Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
- Maintain changelog entries in `CHANGELOG.md`
- Keep .cursor/rules and AGENTS.md up to date

#### API Documentation
- Use `Swagger`/`OpenAPI` for API documentation. The `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` package should be used for this.
- Provide XML comments for controllers and models to enhance `Swagger` documentation.
