#### CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS

- Follow the format: `type(scope): description` for all commit messages
- Use consistent types (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore) across the project
- Include issue references in commit messages to link changes to requirements
- Use breaking change footer (`!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:`) to clearly mark incompatible changes
- Configure commitlint to automatically enforce conventional commit format
