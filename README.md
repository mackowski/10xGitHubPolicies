## About The Project

The 10x GitHub Policy Enforcer is a GitHub App with an accompanying web UI designed to automate the enforcement of organizational policies and security best practices across all repositories within a GitHub organization.

It uses a flexible policy evaluation engine to scan repositories for compliance with a centrally managed configuration file. When violations are found, it can automatically perform actions like creating issues in the repository or archiving it. The web dashboard provides a clear overview of your organization's compliance posture.

The application uses a dual-authentication strategy:
- **GitHub App**: For backend services to perform automated scans and actions
- **GitHub OAuth App**: For user authentication to the web dashboard

---

## Features

*   **Automated Scans:** Performs daily (via scheduled jobs) and on-demand scans of all active repositories.
*   **Centralized Configuration:** All policies are defined in a single `.github/config.yaml` file for easy management.
*   **Extensible Policy Engine:** The application uses a strategy pattern to make it easy to add new policy evaluators.
*   **Automated Actions:** Creates issues or archives repositories that violate policies with duplicate prevention and comprehensive action logging.
*   **Compliance Dashboard:** A Blazor-based web UI to view non-compliant repositories, violation details, and overall compliance metrics.
*   **Background Job Processing:** Uses Hangfire for reliable background processing of scans and actions, ensuring the UI remains responsive.
*   **Action Logging:** All automated actions are logged to the database with status tracking and detailed information.
*   **API Documentation:** Provides Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for any exposed API endpoints.

---

## Configuration

The application is configured via `appsettings.json` and user secrets for sensitive data.

### Test Mode

Test Mode is a special application mode designed for E2E testing and development scenarios. When enabled, it bypasses user authentication and authorization checks, allowing automated testing without requiring real GitHub OAuth tokens or team membership verification.

#### What Test Mode Does

- **Authentication Bypass**: Automatically authenticates users as a fake `mackowski` user
- **Authorization Bypass**: Skips team membership verification (always returns `true`)
- **GitHub App Services**: Remain fully functional for repository operations
- **No Real Tokens**: Eliminates the need for actual GitHub Personal Access Tokens

#### Enabling Test Mode

**Via Configuration File** (Recommended for development):

1. Edit `appsettings.Development.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "TestMode": {
       "Enabled": true
     }
   }
   ```

2. Restart the application:
   ```sh
   dotnet run --launch-profile https
   ```

**Via Environment Variable** (Useful for CI/CD):

```sh
export TestMode__Enabled=true
dotnet run --launch-profile https
```

**Via Command Line** (Temporary override):

```sh
dotnet run --launch-profile https --TestMode:Enabled=true
```

#### Disabling Test Mode

**Via Configuration File**:

1. Edit `appsettings.Development.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "TestMode": {
       "Enabled": false
     }
   }
   ```

2. Restart the application

**Via Environment Variable**:

```sh
export TestMode__Enabled=false
dotnet run --launch-profile https
```

#### Test Mode Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `TestMode:Enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enables/disables test mode authentication bypass |

#### When to Use Test Mode

- **E2E Testing**: Automated browser tests that need to bypass authentication
- **Development**: Local development without GitHub OAuth setup
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing pipelines
- **Demo Environments**: Quick demonstrations without authentication setup

#### Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: Test Mode should **NEVER** be enabled in production environments. It completely bypasses security controls and should only be used in development, testing, or demo scenarios.

### GitHub App Settings
The application uses a dual-authentication strategy requiring both a GitHub App (for backend services) and a GitHub OAuth App (for user authentication).

#### GitHub App (Backend Services)
The GitHub App is used by backend services to perform automated scans and actions against the GitHub API.

1.  Initialize user secrets for the project (if you haven't already):
    ```sh
    cd 10xGitHubPolicies.App
    dotnet user-secrets init
    ```
2.  Set the GitHub App secrets. Replace the placeholder values with your App's credentials:
    ```sh
    dotnet user-secrets set "GitHubApp:AppId" "YOUR_GITHUB_APP_ID"
    dotnet user-secrets set "GitHubApp:InstallationId" "YOUR_GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID"
    dotnet user-secrets set "GitHubApp:PrivateKey" "PASTE_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENTS_HERE"
    ```
    **Note**: When setting the `PrivateKey`, paste the full content of the `.pem` file, including the `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` markers.

3.  Configure the organization name in `appsettings.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "GitHubApp": {
        "OrganizationName": "your-organization-name"
      }
    }
    ```
    Replace `your-organization-name` with your GitHub organization's slug.

#### GitHub App Setup
To create a GitHub App for backend services:

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/apps)
2. Click "New GitHub App"
3. Configure the following:
   - **GitHub App name**: 10x GitHub Policy Enforcer
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://localhost:7040/` (for local development)
   - **Webhook URL**: Leave empty for local development
   - **Repository permissions**:
     - **Administration**: Read & write (to archive repositories)
     - **Contents**: Read-only (to check for file presence)
     - **Issues**: Read & write (to create and check for duplicate issues)
     - **Metadata**: Read-only (to list repositories)
   - **Organization permissions**: None required
4. After creating the app:
   - Note the **App ID** (found on the app's general page)
   - Generate a **Private Key** (download the `.pem` file)
   - Install the app on your organization and note the **Installation ID**

#### GitHub OAuth App (User Authentication)
For user authentication, you need to create a GitHub OAuth App:

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click "New OAuth App"
3. Configure the following:
   - **Application Name**: 10x GitHub Policy Enforcer
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://localhost:7040/` (for local development)
   - **Authorization Callback URL**: `https://localhost:7040/signin-github`
4. Note the Client ID and Client Secret
5. Set the OAuth App secrets:
    ```sh
    dotnet user-secrets set "GitHub:ClientId" "YOUR_OAUTH_APP_CLIENT_ID"
    dotnet user-secrets set "GitHub:ClientSecret" "YOUR_OAUTH_APP_CLIENT_SECRET"
    ```

### Policy Configuration
The policy configuration is managed via a `config.yaml` file located in the root of your organization's `.github` repository.

Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
# .github/config.yaml

# Access control: Specify the GitHub team authorized to access the dashboard.
# Format: 'organization-slug/team-slug'
authorized_team: 'my-org/security-team'

# Policies: Define the rules to enforce across your organization's repositories.
policies:
  - name: 'Check for AGENTS.md'
    type: 'has_agents_md'
    action: 'create_issue' # 'create_issue', 'archive_repo', or 'log_only'
    issue_details:
      title: 'Compliance: AGENTS.md file is missing'
      body: 'This repository is missing the AGENTS.md file in its root directory. Please add this file to comply with organization standards.'
      labels: ['policy-violation', 'documentation']

  - name: 'Check for catalog-info.yaml'
    type: 'has_catalog_info_yaml'
    action: 'create_issue'
    issue_details:
      title: 'Compliance: catalog-info.yaml is missing'
      body: 'This repository is missing the catalog-info.yaml file. This file is required for backstage.io service discovery.'
      labels: ['policy-violation', 'backstage']
      
  - name: 'Verify Workflow Permissions'
    type: 'correct_workflow_permissions'
    action: 'log_only'
```
