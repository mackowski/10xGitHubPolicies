# CI/CD Workflows

## Overview

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment. The main workflow runs on pull requests to ensure code quality, test coverage, and compliance before code is merged.

## Pull Request Workflow

The **Pull Request** workflow (`.github/workflows/pull-request.yml`) is triggered automatically on pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches. It performs checks including code linting, multi-level testing, code coverage reporting, and automatic PR status comments.

### Workflow Structure

The workflow is organized into several interdependent jobs that run in parallel where possible to minimize execution time:

```
lint
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit-tests ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component-tests ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
 ‚îÇ                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration-tests ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
 ‚îÇ                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contract-tests ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê  ‚îÇ
 ‚îÇ                    ‚îÇ                    ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ publish-coverage ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
 ‚îÇ                    ‚îÇ                    ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ                       ‚îÇ
 ‚îÇ                    ‚îÇ                    ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ status-comment ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Jobs

#### 1. Lint Job
**Purpose**: Enforces code formatting standards  
**Runs on**: Every PR  

Performs:

## Security Considerations

### Pinned Action Versions

All GitHub Actions used in workflows are **pinned to full-length commit SHAs** rather than version tags for security compliance. This prevents supply chain attacks from malicious updates to action versions.

**Pinned Actions**:
- `actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11` (v4)
- `actions/setup-dotnet@67a3573c9a986a3f9c594539f4ab511d57bb3ce9` (v4)
- `actions/upload-artifact@ea165f8d65b6e75b540449e92b4886f43607fa02` (v4)
- `actions/download-artifact@d3f86a106a0bac45b974a628896c90dbdf5c8093` (v4)
- `codecov/codecov-action@b9fd7d16f6d7d1b5d2bec1a2887e65ceed900238` (v4)
- `actions/github-script@f28e40c7f34bde8b3046d885e986cb6290c5673b` (v7)

**Updating Action SHAs**:
1. Visit the action's GitHub repository Releases page (e.g., https://github.com/actions/checkout/releases/tag/v4)
2. Find the commit SHA for the desired release
3. Update the SHA in the workflow file
4. Test the workflow to ensure compatibility

### Workflow Permissions

The workflow uses minimal required permissions:
- `contents: read` - Read repository contents
- `packages: read` - Read NuGet packages
- `pull-requests: write` - Create/update PR comments

Following the principle of least privilege reduces the attack surface if a workflow is compromised.

## Code Coverage

### Coverage Collection

Coverage is collected at multiple levels using Coverlet:
- **Unit Tests**: Coverage of business logic and services
- **Component Tests**: Coverage of Blazor components
- **Integration Tests**: Coverage of integration points
- **Contract Tests**: Coverage of contract validation logic

### Coverage Reporting

The aggregated coverage report:
- **Excludes**: Test projects (`*Tests*`, `*TestHelpers*`)
- **Formats**: HTML, JSON Summary, Cobertura XML, Badges
- **Publishes**: To Codecov with separate flags for each test level
- **Filters**: Test helpers and test infrastructure from coverage calculations

### Coverage Targets

While not enforced by CI, the project aims for:
- **Overall Coverage**: 80%+ line coverage
- **Business Logic**: 90%+ line coverage
- **Services**: 85%+ line coverage

## Local Workflow Execution

### Running the Workflow Locally

To replicate the GitHub Actions pull request workflow locally before pushing changes, use the provided script:

```bash
./test-workflow-local.sh
```

This script executes the same sequence as the CI/CD pipeline:
1. **Linting**: Runs `dotnet format --verify-no-changes`
2. **Unit Tests**: Executes all tests with `Category=Unit`
3. **Component Tests**: Executes all tests with `Category=Component`
4. **Integration Tests**: Executes all tests with `Category=Integration`
5. **Contract Tests**: Executes all tests with `Category=Contract`

**Output**:
- Test results are saved to `./coverage/` directory as TRX files
- Console output shows progress and results for each step
- Exits with error code if any step fails

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Catch issues before pushing to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Faster feedback cycle (no CI queue wait)
- ‚úÖ Same test filters and configuration as CI/CD
- ‚úÖ Test result files available for local analysis

**Prerequisites**:
- .NET 8 SDK installed
- All project dependencies restored (`dotnet restore`)
- No database required for integration tests (uses WireMock)

### Manual Workflow Steps

If you prefer to run steps manually or need to debug a specific phase:

```bash
# 1. Linting
dotnet restore
dotnet format --verify-no-changes --verbosity diagnostic

# 2. Unit Tests
dotnet test \
  --filter "Category=Unit" \
  --results-directory ./coverage \
  --logger "trx;LogFileName=unit-tests.trx" \
  --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"

# 3. Component Tests
dotnet test \
  --filter "Category=Component" \
  --results-directory ./coverage \
  --logger "trx;LogFileName=component-tests.trx" \
  --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"

# 4. Integration Tests
dotnet test \
  --filter "Category=Integration" \
  --results-directory ./coverage \
  --logger "trx;LogFileName=integration-tests.trx" \
  --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"

# 5. Contract Tests
dotnet test \
  --filter "Category=Contract" \
  --results-directory ./coverage \
  --logger "trx;LogFileName=contract-tests.trx" \
  --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Failures

**Lint Failure**:
```bash
# Fix formatting issues locally
dotnet format

# Verify no changes
dotnet format --verify-no-changes
```

**Test Failures**:
- Check test output in GitHub Actions logs
- Run failing tests locally: `dotnet test --filter "Category=Unit"`
- Review test artifacts uploaded to workflow examples
- Use local workflow script: `./test-workflow-local.sh`

**Coverage Report Missing**:
- Verify coverage files are generated in test jobs
- Check artifact upload/download steps succeeded
- Review ReportGenerator installation step

**PR Comment Not Appearing**:
- Ensure workflow has `pull-requests: write` permission
- Check that `github.event_name == 'pull_request'` condition is met
- Review GitHub Script action logs for API errors

**Local Script Issues**:
- Ensure script has execute permissions: `chmod +x test-workflow-local.sh`
- Verify .NET SDK is installed: `dotnet --version`
- Check test project dependencies are restored: `dotnet restore`
